# cmatrix
The Matrix effect written for windows.

Have you ever wanted that epic matrix feel from *nix operating systems such as BSD's and Linux's iconic `cmatrix` package? Have you not cared about installing mingw 64 like how the original repository describes you to do to use ![their](https://github.com/abishekvashok/cmatrix) software? Have you been slightly dissapointed by ![this](https://github.com/matriex/cmatrix) repository having to do some goofy screen saver stuff? Do you want a simple exe? Say no more Windows users, I have just the solution.
